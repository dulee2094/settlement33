  # Set the base directory to 'deploy'.
  # This serves two purposes:
  # 1. It points Netlify to the folder containing only the static files we want to serve.
  # 2. It isolates the build from the root 'package.json', preventing 'npm install' and the associated 'extensions' error.

  # Publish the current directory (which is 'deploy' because of the base setting above).

  # This overrides any default behavior.
